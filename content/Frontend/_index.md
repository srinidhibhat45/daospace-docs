### Front End

# About the front end of the project

**Design Pattern:**

This chat application is built using MERN stack using the GetStream API components for the React UI and Node Backend.

Getstream provides chat API for Custom Messaging applications. Stream provides and stores the user data, which we have configured to store in our MongoDB database. (We are using the online version of it, MongoDB Atlas)
